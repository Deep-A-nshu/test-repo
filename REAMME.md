Hello people. This is me, Deepanshu, starting a new test repo in github as a part of learning the basic commands in github.
So, currently I have learnt about how to do basic version controlling using git bash and also how to push files in a github repo which are present in the computer using git bash.
Next up is push and pull requests.
